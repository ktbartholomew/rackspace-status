                <p>We perform maintenance to continue to deliver optimal performance, reliability and security. We strive to perform them without impact to our customers; however, the possibility always exists that a maintenance event can have unintended consequences up to and including unplanned or extended service interruption. We hope you understand that such maintenances are necessary to benefit you and your customers.</p>
                <p>If we expect a maintenance event to cause service disruption we will use reasonable efforts to post advance notice of the maintenance. For example, if we have to remove a system element to perform maintenance, we will transfer the system to a redundant element to minimize downtime, but there may be some downtime while the system transfers to the redundant element.</p>
                <p>If maintenance is urgently needed, we may not be able to give much, or any, advance notice; for example, we may need to install critical security updates or replace failed system components.</p>
